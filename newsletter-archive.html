            <h3>January 2024 Newsletter</h3>
            <p>
            Happy new year! I still can’t believe it’s the end of January already!
            </p>
            <p>
            I’m really excited to be releasing this new single, Infiltrate. 
            </p>   
            <p>
                It was finished nearly a year ago, and I know I’ve mentioned this before, but it’s still wild to me how long that conveyor belt is from the first demo to the final release product, and then the second conveyor belt of making sure everything is ready for the release. 
                Still, we made it and I FINALLY get to show you Infiltrate.
